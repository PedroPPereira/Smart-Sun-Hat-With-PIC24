# Smart Sun Hat with PIC24

**Course:** Data Aquisition Systems

**Academic Year:** 2019/20

**Semester:** 2nd

**Grade:** 20 out of 20

**Technologies Used:** C, PIC24

**Brief Description:** Intelligent sun hat with PIC24 and the Explorer 16 board.

The functionality of the system to be implemented is a sun hat that “searches” for the sun to prevent the user from being exposed. LDR sensors will be used to identify the position of the sun. Once the direction of the sun is identified, the engine is activated to position the hat in the correct position. In the situation where the user wants to be exposed to the sun, there is a button that switches to 'tanning' mode.

The system will have a temperature sensor. When the temperature exceeds a value set by the user, a fan is activated automatically. to set the fan speed a potentiometer is used.

In order to activate the sun hat, a 4 letter password is needed.
